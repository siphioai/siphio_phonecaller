SIPHIO PHONE SYSTEM - NEXT STEPS FOR LIVE TESTING
=================================================

Your ngrok URL is configured: https://79c9e80e881e.ngrok-free.app

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
-------------------------
1. Update your Twilio Auth Token in .env file:
   - Open .env file
   - Find: TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="REPLACE_WITH_NEW_TOKEN_AFTER_REGENERATING"
   - Replace with your actual auth token from Twilio Console

2. Run the configuration update:
   python update_twilio_config.py https://79c9e80e881e.ngrok-free.app

3. Start the server:
   - Open a command prompt
   - Navigate to: C:\Users\marley\siphio_phone
   - Activate virtual environment: venv\Scripts\activate
   - Start server: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

4. Test your setup:
   - Call your Twilio number: +441615243042
   - You should hear: "Thank you for calling. How may I assist you today?"

WHAT'S WORKING NOW:
------------------
✓ Ngrok tunnel configured
✓ WebSocket handling implemented
✓ Audio buffering with Voice Activity Detection
✓ Conversation state management
✓ Security measures (encryption, masking)
✓ Redis service stub for future scaling
✓ Comprehensive test coverage

MONITORING:
-----------
Watch the server console for:
- "Incoming call: CA..." - Call received
- "WebSocket connection accepted" - Audio streaming started
- "Media stream started" - Audio is flowing

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If you see "Invalid signature" errors, TWILIO_VALIDATE_REQUESTS is already set to False
- If no audio, check that ngrok is still running
- If server errors, check the console output

NEXT DEVELOPMENT STEPS:
----------------------
After successful testing, we'll implement:
1. Deepgram STT integration (Week 1)
2. PostgreSQL database layer (Week 1)
3. Claude AI conversation engine (Week 2)
4. ElevenLabs TTS integration (Week 2)

Your server is ready - just update the auth token and start testing!
