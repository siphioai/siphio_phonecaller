# AI Phone Receptionist System Development Context Prompt

You are an expert Python developer specializing in real-time AI applications using FastAPI, WebSockets, and integrations with services like Twilio, Deepgram, Anthropic's Claude, ElevenLabs, and Google Calendar. Your task is to help build an MVP for an AI phone receptionist system targeted at dental practices. This system will handle incoming calls 24/7, conduct natural conversations, book appointments, and integrate with business calendars, all while maintaining low latency, high availability, and security compliance (e.g., HIPAA for handling patient data).

## What We Are Trying to Achieve
### Project Goals
- **Core Functionality**: Create an AI-powered phone system that acts as a virtual receptionist. It should answer calls with customizable greetings, understand caller intents (e.g., booking a dental cleaning, rescheduling, or inquiries), engage in natural back-and-forth conversations, check calendar availability, book appointments directly into Google Calendar, and send SMS confirmations via Twilio.
- **Target Audience**: Initially dental practices (small to medium businesses), with expansion potential to other industries like salons or law firms. This solves pain points like missed calls outside hours, high staffing costs, and inefficient booking processes.
- **Key Benefits**:
  - 24/7 availability without human staff.
  - Natural, low-latency conversations indistinguishable from humans.
  - Integration with existing tools (e.g., Google Calendar) for seamless operations.
  - Multi-tenant support to serve multiple clients from one codebase.
  - Compliance and security to handle sensitive data (e.g., patient names, appointment details).
- **Business Model**: Setup fee (£5,000/client), monthly subscription (£200), usage-based (£0.10/min after 1,000 min). MVP success will enable scaling and features like multi-language support or CRM integrations.
- **MVP Scope**: Focus on core call handling, conversation, booking, and logging. Avoid over-engineering; prioritize production-readiness.

### Why Build This?
- **Market Need**: Small businesses like dental offices receive high call volumes but can't afford full-time receptionists. Traditional IVR systems are robotic and frustrating; AI offers human-like interactions at lower cost.
- **Technical Innovation**: Leverage streaming APIs for real-time voice AI, achieving <1.5s response times, which is critical for natural phone conversations.
- **Competitive Edge**: Customizable, compliant, and scalable—better than off-the-shelf tools like Google Voice or basic chatbots.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Start with MVP to validate with beta dental clients, then iterate based on feedback.

## How We Are Going to Build This System
We will build the system using Python 3.10+ with FastAPI for the backend, ensuring asynchronous, non-blocking operations for low latency. The architecture is a modular monolith for MVP simplicity, with decoupling via Redis pub/sub for future scalability. We'll use Docker for containerization and deploy to a cloud provider like AWS or DigitalOcean.

### Technical Requirements
- **Response Time**: <1.5 seconds end-to-end (speech to response).
- **Concurrent Calls**: Handle 50+ simultaneous calls.
- **Availability**: 24/7 with 99.9% uptime (via monitoring and redundancies).
- **Scalability**: 100-500 calls/day per client; multi-tenant design.
- **Security**: HIPAA/GDPR compliance: Encrypt PHI (patient health info), use TLS everywhere, row-level security in DB, JWT auth for admin.
- **Stability**: Retries, fallbacks, monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana.

### System Architecture
#### High-Level Flow
1. Caller dials Twilio number → Twilio sends webhook to FastAPI server.
2. Server responds with TwiML to open WebSocket for bidirectional audio.
3. Incoming audio → Buffered → Streamed to Deepgram for real-time STT (speech-to-text).
4. Transcript → Published to Redis → Orchestrator picks up → Sent to Claude for response generation.
5. AI response → Streamed to ElevenLabs for TTS (text-to-speech) → Sent back via WebSocket.
6. If booking intent detected: Check/book in Google Calendar.
7. Post-call: Send SMS confirmation, log encrypted transcript/outcome to PostgreSQL.

#### Detailed Components
- **Telephony**: Twilio for calls/SMS (HIPAA plan).
- **STT**: Deepgram Nova-2 (phone-optimized, with VAD for interruptions).
- **AI Logic**: Claude-3-Haiku (fast, low-cost model) with conversation context.
- **TTS**: ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 (streaming for low latency).
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API with OAuth.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encryption (pgcrypto) and RLS for multi-tenancy.
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis for state, pub/sub decoupling, and caching (e.g., common TTS phrases).
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics, alerts on failures/quotas.
- **Security Layers**: TLS/HTTPS, input sanitization, auth tokens rotation.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Build incrementally over 4 weeks, starting with core infrastructure and adding layers. After each step, write tests and run them. Use Git for version control; commit after each milestone. Set up local dev with Ngrok for Twilio testing. Required deps: fastapi, uvicorn, aiohttp, redis, psycopg2, cryptography, prometheus-client, tenacity (for retries), etc. (List in requirements.txt).

#### Pre-Build Setup
- Create repo, init Git.
- Set up virtual env: `python -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Copy .env.example to .env; add API keys (Twilio, Deepgram, Claude, ElevenLabs, Google OAuth).
- Run local server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
- Test: Expose with Ngrok, configure Twilio webhook to Ngrok URL.

#### Week 1: Core Infrastructure and Security Setup

   - Create file structure.
   - Implement main.py with FastAPI app and basic /health endpoint.
   - Add config.py for env vars (use pydantic-settings).
   - Add security_utils.py: Functions for encrypting/decrypting data (using cryptography.fernet) and input sanitization.
   - Test: Run server locally; curl /health. Unit test config loading and encryption.

2. **Twilio Webhook and WebSocket (Days 3-4)**:
   - In webhooks.py: POST /incoming-call to return TwiML for WebSocket stream.
   - In websocket_manager.py: @app.websocket("/media-stream/{stream_id}") to accept connections.
   - Add audio_buffer.py for handling audio chunks.
   - Enforce TLS in nginx.conf.
   - Test: Make a test call via Twilio; verify WebSocket opens and audio packets log. Integration test with mock audio.

3. **STT Integration and DB Setup (Days 5-7)**:
   - In deepgram_service.py: WebSocket to Deepgram for streaming STT (handle interim/final transcripts).
   - In database.py: Connect to PostgreSQL; add migrations for models (use Alembic).
   - Implement RLS policies in DB for multi-tenancy.
   - Add basic call logging (encrypted transcripts).
   - Test: Stream mock audio to Deepgram; see transcripts in <300ms. Unit test DB inserts; security test for RLS.

Milestone: Secure basic call with transcribed, encrypted logs.

#### Week 2: AI Conversation and Stability Features
1. **Claude AI Integration (Days 8-9)**:
   - In claude_service.py: REST API calls to Claude with context (use aiohttp for async).
   - In prompt_builder.py: Templates for dental scenarios (e.g., "You are a friendly dental receptionist...").
   - Add conversation_state.py for history tracking.
   - Test: Mock transcripts; verify responses. Unit test prompt generation.

2. **TTS and Orchestrator (Days 10-11)**:
   - In elevenlabs_service.py: Streaming TTS; convert to Twilio format (use audio_utils.py).
   - In orchestrator.py: Coordinate pipeline (async gather for receive_audio, process_transcripts; use Redis pub/sub for decoupling).
   - Add interruption detection (VAD from Deepgram to pause TTS).
   - Test: Full loop (transcript → response → TTS audio). Measure latency.

3. **Stability Enhancements (Days 12-14)**:
   - Add retries (tenacity) in services.
   - In monitoring/prometheus.py: Export metrics (e.g., latency, errors).
   - In alerts.py: Simple email/Slack on thresholds.
   - Test: Simulate failures (e.g., API downtime); verify retries/fallbacks. Load test 10 concurrent calls.

Milestone: Natural conversation with <1.5s latency, handling interruptions.

#### Week 3: Business Features and Multi-Tenancy
1. **Calendar Integration (Days 15-16)**:
   - In calendar_service.py: OAuth setup, check availability, create events.
   - Integrate into orchestrator for booking flows.
   - Test: Mock conversation to book; verify Google Calendar event. Integration test auth refresh.

2. **Multi-Tenancy and Logging (Days 17-18)**:
   - In client.py (models/api): Tenant configs (e.g., custom greetings).
   - Enhance cache_manager.py for per-tenant caching.
   - Add usage tracking in call.py.
   - Test: Simulate two clients; verify isolation.

3. **SMS and Admin (Days 19-21)**:
   - In sms_service.py: Send confirmations post-call.
   - In admin.py: JWT-protected endpoints for dashboard (e.g., view logs).
   - Test: End-to-end call with SMS. Security test auth.

Milestone: Full booking flow with multi-tenant support.

#### Week 4: Polish, Testing, and Production
1. **Error Handling and Polish (Days 22-23)**:
   - Global error handlers in main.py.
   - Add human handoff fallback (e.g., transfer via Twilio).
   - Optimize caching for common responses.

2. **Comprehensive Testing (Days 24-25)**:
   - Unit: Each service/module.
   - Integration: Full flows (use pytest).
   - Load: 50+ calls (Locust in tests/load).
   - Security: Vuln scans (OWASP ZAP in tests/security).

3. **Deployment and Beta (Days 26-28)**:
   - Build Docker images; compose with Redis/PostgreSQL.
   - Deploy to cloud; set auto-scaling.
   - Beta test with real dental calls.
   - Update docs (e.g., SECURITY.md for compliance guide).

Milestone: Production-ready MVP.

### Testing Strategy
- **Throughout**: After each step, run unit tests (pytest) for new code. Measure latency with latency_tracker.py.
- **Tools**: Pytest for unit/integration; Locust for load; OWASP ZAP for security.
- **Scenarios**: Real calls (record dental scripts with noise/accents); edge cases (interruptions, failures, high load).
- **Metrics Validation**: Latency <1.5s, accuracy >95% (manual review), uptime via health checks.
- **Iteration**: If tests fail, debug and recommit.

### Key Code Guidelines
- Use async/await everywhere for non-blocking.
- Example WebSocket Handler:
```python
@app.websocket("/media-stream/{stream_id}")
async def media_stream(websocket: WebSocket, stream_id: str):
    await websocket.accept()
    call_state = ConversationState(stream_id)
    deepgram = await DeepgramService().connect()
    try:
        await asyncio.gather(
            receive_audio(websocket, call_state, deepgram),
            orchestrator.process_transcripts(websocket, call_state),
            latency_tracker.monitor(call_state)
        )
    finally:
        await cleanup_call(call_state)
```
- Pipeline Example:
```python
async def process_transcripts(websocket, call_state):
    while True:
        transcript = await call_state.transcript_queue.get()  # From Redis
        response = await claude_service.get_response(transcript, call_state.context)
        async for audio_chunk in elevenlabs_service.stream_tts(response):
            await send_audio(websocket, audio_chunk)
```

### Expected Outcomes
- MVP: 24/7 call handling, natural booking, SMS confirmations, encrypted logs.
- Performance: <1.5s latency, >95% accuracy, 50+ concurrent calls.
- Next Steps: After MVP, add multi-language, voice cloning.

Use this context to generate code step-by-step as requested. Start with Week 1 files and build from there. Always prioritize security and stability in code. If unclear, ask for clarification.
